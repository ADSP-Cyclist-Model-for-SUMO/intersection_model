# intersection_model

External simulation model that can be linked to SUMO to enable realistic left turning behavior of cyclists at signaled intersections.

To run the model, the respective variables in settings.py need to be set. 

Note that when evaluating the model's hyperparameters (eval_hyperparameters==True), the sumoBinary should be set to ".../bin/sumo" to speed up the evaluation.
